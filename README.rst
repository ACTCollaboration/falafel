This library allows you to reconstruct CMB lensing maps on the cut or full
skies. It is SHT-based and uses a cylindrical projection in intermediate steps
which allows it to be fast and memory efficient. The implementation closely
follows that in the Planck 2018 lensing analysis by Julien Carron and others.
